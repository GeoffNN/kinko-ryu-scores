This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a music transcription application that converts solo instrumental music into Kinko-ryu style musical notation. The project is currently in its early specification phase.

## Project Goals

The application allows users to:
- Upload music files or provide YouTube URLs
- Upload Western-style score sheets for conversion
- Transcribe solo instrumental music to Kinko-ryu style notation
- Generate and download PDF scores
- View scores in the browser

## Current State

The codebase contains only a specification file (`specs.md`) outlining the project requirements. No implementation has been started yet.

## Development Notes

- This appears to be a greenfield project for music transcription
- The target output format is Kinko-ryu style notation (a traditional Japanese musical notation system)
- The application will need audio processing, music analysis, and PDF generation capabilities
- Web interface with drag-and-drop file upload functionality is required
