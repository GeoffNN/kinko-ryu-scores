We want to build an app that listens to solo music with a single instrument, and transcribes music on a score sheet in Kinko-ryu style music writing.

The user should be upload a music file, or point to a youtube url, or gives a western style score sheet. There's a drag n drop box. Then a transcribe button. The app then analyzes the music, and writes out a score sheet in Kinkoryu style. It outputs a PDF of the score, and makes it available for download by the user. It also shows it in the browser screen.
